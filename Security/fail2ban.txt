1. On Ubuntu, fail2ban is included in the standard repo. Installing Fail2ban to your box is as easy as:
    # sudo apt update && sudo apt install fail2ban

2. First, let’s change the port used by sshd to listen to incoming connection
    # sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    - Find this line
    # Port 22

    - Uncomment and change it to
    Port 2266

    - Replace “2266” with the port you want to use. Save and close the config file, and restart sshd
    # systemctl restart sshd

3. Next, create ufw app profile for the new port configuration.
    # sudo nano /etc/ufw/applications.d/openssh-server

    - ..and modify it accordingly, from
    [OpenSSH]
    title=Secure shell server, an rshd replacement
    description=OpenSSH is a free implementation of the Secure Shell protocol.
    ports=22/tcp

    - To look like this
    [OpenSSH]
    title=Secure shell server, an rshd replacement
    description=OpenSSH is a free implementation of the Secure Shell protocol.
    ports=22/tcp

    [OpenSSH-2266]
    title=Secure shell server, an rshd replacement
    description=OpenSSH is a free implementation of the Secure Shell protocol.
    ports=2266/tcp

    - Ufw should now report our custom sshd port profile on its’ app list
    test@test:~$ sudo ufw app list
    Available applications:
    OpenSSH
    OpenSSH-2266

4. To customize the sshd jail, open the jail configuration file
    # sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local

    - And configure it to look like this
    [ssh]
    port = 2266
    action = ufw[application="OpenSSH-2266", blocktype=reject]
    logpath = %(sshd_log)s
    backend = %(sshd_backend)s

    - Reload fail2ban so that it recognizes the new jail configuration
    # sudo fail2ban-client reload

    - Now you can test the jail. Try logging in to the box with invalid credentials a couple of times, and check the jail status
    test@test:~$ sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
    Status for the jail: sshd
